# Modbus-to-MQTT-Vibration-Sensor-Data-Publisher
This project reads sensor data from a Modbus TCP server and publishes the data to an MQTT broker. The data is fetched from Modbus registers, decoded, and then sent as JSON formatted messages to the MQTT broker. The system also logs the sensor data and any errors to both the console and a log file for easy debugging and analysis.
